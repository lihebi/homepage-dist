2010 interview:

<blockquote>
<p>
What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the
enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell
everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go
'yes' or 'no,' and if enough of them say 'yes,' we get to come to work
tomorrow. That's how it works. It's really simple. With the enterprise
market, it's not so simple. The people that use the products don't
decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions
sometimes are confused. We love just trying to make the best products
in the world for people and having them tell us by how they vote with
their wallets whether we're on track or not.

<p>
From Steve Jobs’ Commencement address on June 12, 2005:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My third story is about death.
</p>

<p>
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: <b>“If you live
each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be
right.”</b> It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33
years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:
<b>“If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am
about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many
days in a row, I know I need to change something.</b>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
<b>almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important.</b> Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. <b>You are already naked. There is no reason not
to follow your heart.</b>
</p>

<p>
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in
the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t
even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect
to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go
home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare
to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d
have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to
make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as
possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.
</p>

<p>
I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a
biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my
stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got
a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors
started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of
pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and
I’m fine now.
</p>

<p>
This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the
closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can
now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a
useful but purely intellectual concept:
</p>

<p>
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want
to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No
one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is
very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change
agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the
new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually
become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is
quite true.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s
life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of
other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown
out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to
follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</b>
</p>

Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
the round pegs in the square holes… The ones who see things
differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree
with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is
ignore them because they change things… They push the human race
forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius,
because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change
the world, are the ones who do.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way
to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the
only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found
it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart,
you’ll know when you find it.
